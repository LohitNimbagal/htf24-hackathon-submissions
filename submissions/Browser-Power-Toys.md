## Browser Power Toys

## Project Description    
The Project I created is Browser Power Toys, a set of tools designed specifically for power users who want to maximize productivity directly within the browser. The first tool in this suite is YouTube Power Toys, which enhances the YouTube experience.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The story behind **Browser Power Toys** started with my own experiences as a dedicated YouTube user. YouTube is an amazing free resource for both learning and entertainment, and its recommendation algorithm consistently serves up valuable content. But as someone who uses YouTube daily, I found myself hitting the **5,000-video** limit on the **Watch Later playlist** - a frustrating cap that forced me to create new playlists and go through extras steps just to save new videos. This interrupted my focus, especially when I was deep into learning.

This experience sparked the idea for **YouTube Power Toys** - a tool that would streamline video management, helping power users like me stay organized without extra distractions. 
Currently, YouTube Power Toys is the first tool in the Browser Power Toys suite, designed to enhance the YouTube experience. Although right now it focuses on YouTube, the plan is to expand Browser Power Toys to include similar productivity tools for other platforms, ultimately creating a complete toolkit for power users across the web.

### Browser Power Toys

1. **YouTube Power Tools**: This tool displays an icon on every video on YouTube. When clicked, it automatically finds the playlist for the current month (if one doesn't exist, it creates a new playlist for the month) and adds the video to it. This feature streamlines the process of organizing and saving videos for easy access later.


## Tech Stack    

I built **Browser Power Toys Extension**, using **vanilla JavaScript** and **CSS** with **Manifest V3** for the Chrome extension framework.

For the **frontend**, I used **Next.js** for server-side rendering and a smooth user experience, combined with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Shadcn** for UI components. This combination allows for a responsive, modern interface that enhances usability.

On the **backend**, I utilized **Next.js API routes** to handle server-side logic and communication. Additionally, I integrated **Appwrite Cloud** for authentication and database management, ensuring secure user management and data storage.
